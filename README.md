# sql-data-insert
Python script to generate an output.sql file which can be run in sql server / mySQL 
in order to bulk data insert from an input document which may be in .csv or .txt format
depending on the user.

TODO:
-Combine scripts of the same OS into 1 .py file and filter depending on input file type
-Clean up code and support more sql data types
